### Hi, I'm Andrew :)

#### A little about myself
I'm an experienced marketing profesional who is passionate about technology. I work for TotalMount, the trusted leader in electronics mounting. In my current role as a Product Marketing Manager, I've helped my team launch over 40 products in the consumer electronics mounting segment.

I lead the go-to-market strategy for all upcoming TotalMount products. I have extensive knowledge of the Amazon selling platform, including 5,000+ hours of advertising experience (Amazon Ads platform, Amazon Attribution, and Amazon Storefront).

Before being promoted to Product Marketing Manager, I spearheaded our social media launch and grew our following from zero to over 70,000 users.

#### Personal life
I'm an avid photographer. I spent several years working professionally in the action-sports industry as a photographer and videographer. I've worked for some cool brands like Adidas (skateboarding division), Lakai Footwear, Girl Skateboards, Welcome Skateboards, and The Hundreds.

If you find some old skateboarding magazines lying around then there's a chance you might see some of my photos. I've been internationally published in *Thrasher Magazine* (250k+ circulation), *The Skateboard Mag* (formerly 90k+ circulation), and *Transworld SKATEboarding* (formerly 85k+ circulation). I was also nationally published in the Canadian publications *SBC Skateboard* and *Color Magazine*.
